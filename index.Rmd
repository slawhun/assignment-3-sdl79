## About Sarah

* I'm a freshwater ecologist from the Chicago area and I love the Great Lakes. Lake Michigan is my current study system.

* When I'm not out on the lakes, I love mushroom foraging, sewing historical costumes, knitting, making soup, hiking, and hanging out with my friends and/or cats.
